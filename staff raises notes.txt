Attended CAS Directors Meeting

We discussed faculty raises.

CAS has recieved a "pool" of money.

July 2 date for assigning raises by Director.

Funds (allocation) for each school TBD.

Will have names, salaries of eligible faculty.

$ amount of raise will be left to director, raises will be merit based.

Use spreadsheet of annual evaluation numbers.

Eligibility - hired before July 1, 2023.

Raise pool from the state of MS for E&G.

Also, "forced distribution" of raises: 10 to 30% will be between 0 to 2.9% raise, 40 to 60% of faculty will recieve 3 to 5% raise, 60 to 100% of faculty will be 5%+ up to 9.9% raise. So, the raises need to be meaningful. 

Raises implemented in August/September.

Justification may/can include some compression issues - but lean hard into performance when writing the justification.

Staff raises will be forthcoming (timing is TBD)

max is 9.9%

10 to 30%, < 3%
40 to 80%, 3 to 5%
10 to 30%, > 5% up to 9.9%

Roughly equal allocation in each of the above bins.
